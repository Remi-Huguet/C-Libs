# C-Libs
Some functions from the basic C libraries were made, along with new ones.

## Description
This project creates a library with many functions from the string.h library and other utility functions like printf and malloc.
Some functions were very easy to implement, while others were much more challenging.
The idea behind this project was to refactor projects I did in my first year at Epitech after gaining more knowledge.
All functions have unit tests.

## Install Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt install gcc
```

## Run
```bash
make
```

## Install Unit Tests Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt install libcriterion-dev
```

## Run Unit Tests
```bash
make tests_run
```

## Rm files generated by 'make' or 'make tests_run'
```bash
make fclean
```

## Functions handled

### String management :
- array_contain(check if a array contain a str)
- array_get_len (get len of an array)
- array_is_same (check if two array are the same)
- int_to_str (convert a string to an int)
- str_contain (check if a string contain a caractere)
- str_concatenate (concatenate two strings)
- str_copy (copy a string in an other)
- str_duplicate (duplicate a string)
- str_get_len (strlen that return int not size_t)
- str_is_integer (check if a string is a integer in string format)
- str_is_same (like strcmp, but return a boolean)
- str_reverse (reverse a string)
- str_to_array (a split function)
- str_to_int (convert a string to a int)
### Memory management :
- allocate_memory (malloc)
- copy_memory (memcpy)
- free_memory (free)
- reallocate_memory (realloc)
### To print :
- print_binary (print an int in binary)
- print_char (print a char)
- print_float (print a float)
- print_formatted (printf with these flags handled : 's', 'c', 'd', 'i', 'o', 'x', 'X', '%', 'b' and 'f' withtout .xf handled)
- print_hexa (print an int in hexa)
- print_int (print a nint)
- print_octal (print an int in octal)
- print_str (print a string)

## Functions that can be implemented in the future:
- All utility functions for managing strings, arrays, integers, or characters.
- Other system utility functions that rely on different concepts (e.g., creating an "ls" command to analyze files and directories).
