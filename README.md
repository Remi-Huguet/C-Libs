# C-Libs
Some functions from the basics c libs maked, and new ones.

## Description
This project create a lib with a lot of function of the string.h lib and others utils functions like printf or malloc.
Some functions were very easy to do, others were way more difficult.
The idea of this project was to refacto projects i've done in first year of studies, but after learning more things.

## Run
```bash
make
```

## Run Unit Tests Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt install libcriterion-dev
```

## Run Unit Tests
```bash
make tests_run
```

## Rm files generated by 'make' or 'make tests_run'
```bash
make fclean
```
